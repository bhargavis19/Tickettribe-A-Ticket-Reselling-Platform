TicketTribe is a mobile application designed to streamline the ticket-selling process for concerts and shows. It allows users to easily buy or resell tickets when they are unable to attend events. Whether you have last-minute plans or want to buy tickets for a sold-out event, TicketTribe is your go-to solution.

- **Buy Tickets:** Users can browse and purchase tickets for upcoming events.
- **Resell Tickets:** Users can post their purchased tickets for resale in case they are unable to attend.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** TicketTribe provides a clean, intuitive interface to make ticket buying and selling effortless.
- **Secure Transactions:** Ensures safe and secure payment processes for both buyers and sellers.

## Tech Stack

- **Java:** Used for implementing the backend logic and functionalities.
- **XML:** Used for designing the frontend user interface.
- **Firebase:** For user authentication and data storage.

## Tools

- **Figma:** Used to design the wireframes and prototypes for the app.
- **Android Studio:** Primary development environment for the app.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TicketTribe.git

I made this application an year ago, and during that time Android studio allowed us to create apps through both JAVA and Kotlin. But now, Android Studio allows to create apps using Kotlin only, so this code may not work so i am attaching the figma file for reference.
